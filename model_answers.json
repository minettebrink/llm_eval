        "question": "What is the value of (-1)/2*-310*(-73)/(-365)*-3*28/105*10/2*5/5?",
        "answer": "1. First, let's simplify the expression by canceling out the common factors in the fractions:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-1}{2} * -310 * \\frac{-73}{-365} * -3 * \\frac{28}{105} * \\frac{10}{2} * \\frac{5}{5}\n   \\]\n   Notice that \\(-365\\) and \\(-73\\) share a factor of 73, and \\(-105\\) and \\(-28\\) share a factor of 7. Also, \\(-10\\) and \\(-2\\) and 5 can be canceled out.\n\n2. After canceling out the common factors, the expression becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-1}{2} * -310 * \\frac{-1}{-5} * -3 * \\frac{4}{15} * \\frac{1}{1} * \\frac{1}{1}\n   \\]\n   Now, we can simplify the expression further by multiplying the remaining numbers.\n\n3. Multiply the numerators and denominators separately:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-1 * -310 * -1 * -3 * 4 * 1 * 1}{2 * -5 * 15 * 1 * 1}\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{310 * 3 * 4}{2 * 5 * 15}\n   \\]\n\n4. Now, let's calculate the final value:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{310 * 3 * 4}{2 * 5 * 15} = \\frac{3720}{150} = 24.8\n   \\]\n   The answer is 24.8"

        "question": "Five letters picked without replacement from {h: 3, l: 5}. What is prob of sequence lllll?",
        "answer": "1. First, calculate the total number of ways to pick 5 letters from the set {h: 3, l: 5}. This can be done using the combination formula $\\binom{n}{k}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $k$ is the number of items to choose. In this case, $n = 8$ (3 h's and 5 l's) and $k = 5$. So, the total number of ways is $\\binom{8}{5}$.\n\n2. Next, calculate the number of ways to pick the sequence 'lllll'. Since there are 5 l's and we need to pick all 5, there is only 1 way to do this.\n\n3. The probability of picking the sequence 'lllll' is the number of ways to pick 'lllll' divided by the total number of ways to pick 5 letters. So, the probability is $\\frac{1}{\\binom{8}{5}}$.\nThe answer is $\\frac{1}{56}$.\n\n4. To give the solution as a float, we can calculate $\\frac{1}{56}$ as a decimal. This gives us approximately 0.0179. The answer is 0.0179."
