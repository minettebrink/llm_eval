I might change the model to a smaller and cheaper one, but I still want to use a model that is considerd good enough. My plan is to use several small open source models to evaluate the mahtematics model. I'll also use different models for the mathematics chatbot and for the evaluation models to get realible results."

      "   Fermat's Last Theorem is stated as follows: There are no three positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy the equation $a^n + b^n = c^n$ for any integer value of $n$ greater than 2. In other words, the equation has no solutions in positive integers for $n > 2$.\n",

      "   This theorem was proposed by Pierre de Fermat in 1637. Fermat himself claimed to have a proof that was too large to fit in the margin of his book, but no complete proof from Fermat has ever been found. This problem remained one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics for centuries.\n",

      "4. **Solution:**\n",

This was rigorously proven by Andrew Wiles, closing one of the most famous chapters in the history of mathematics.\n",
